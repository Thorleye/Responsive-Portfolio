                <p>
                    I am a fullstack developer student part time/ manufacturing sales rep full time. I am learning the skills of web development to further my career and give myself the skills needed to be competive in an ever-evolving workforce.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Born and raised in Toronto, I received my BA in 2012 from the University of Toronto before returning in 2018 for the full stack development bootcamp program from the school of continuing studies. I have done volunteer work with churches, the children's aid society, community outreach programs and the Heart and Stroke foundation. I have worked jobs in a few kitchens, and in my current role as a sales rep at a steel company.

                    In my spare time I am cheering for the Raptors, Blue Jays & Green Bay Packers. I'm also catching up on the latest tv, or some non-fiction in book or podcast form. Check out the links in the Portfolio page for my latest projects.
